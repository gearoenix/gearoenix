## Licensing

The engine itself is completely free to use, but the engine is using FMOD for sound, and it is not free to use, one can replace the FMOD and use other libraries for sound.

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains code demonstrating Gearoenix's functionalities. 

**WebAssembly Demos** (Note: Web data is not optimized for performance)

These demos showcase Gearoenix running in WebAssembly, but keep in mind that web data is not specifically optimized for this purpose.
